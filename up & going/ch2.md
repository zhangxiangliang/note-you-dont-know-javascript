# You Don't Know JS: Up & Going
## Chapter 2: Into JavaScript

### Values & Types
Javascript has typed value, not typed variables. The following built-in types are available:
 * `string`
 * `number`
 * `boolean`
 * `null`
 * `undefined`
 * `object`
 * `symbol`

### Typeof
* `typeof null` is an interesting case, because it errantly returns `"object"`, when you'd expect it to return `"null"`.
* `typeof "abc"` returns `"string"`, not `strings`.
